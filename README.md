Software professional with over 10 yearsâ€™ experience in the development and maintenance of Java web applications. My experience with the development of web applications consists of such technologies as: Java, Servlets, JSP, JSTL, Tags, Struts, Spring and Hibernate as well as some older technologies. Over the past several years I have been working with Java based Content Management Systems (Fatwire & OpenText WEM) and have faced the challenges that come with working within the constraints of a platform head on and 
with a smile.

I work well within a team and enjoy teaming up and programming together, but also I like putting on some headphones and 
working autonomously to deliver quality results.

I have been working under the AGILE methodology of sprints, reviews, retros, sprint planning and very much enjoy this style of software development. 
I believe the process of peers reviewing code before it gets committed to a release helps a developer learn and grow. Over the years I have come to see Test Driven Development (TTD) a very useful process to adopt as well as automation in the areas of testing and build processes. Finally monitoring web sites and logs is another important feature to me to help visualize areas for improvement, be that performance of the code base or finding bugs before the customer does.

I have some experience working with Amazon Web Services and the AWS product suite.

Looking for an awesome team that is not only fun but relishes in delivering quality products that people WANT to use. I need a team that will help me improve my knowledge and wisdom of software development and a team I can share my experiences with over the years and help members grow.

Lastly, I am currently dedicating time to learning python and looking for ways to incorporate my new skills within my role.
